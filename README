Your task is to implement the functions defined in the five hash table types.
You can run our automated timing and test suite by running

   ./run-tests
   
from the command-line.

Once you've gotten everything working, crank the optimizer up to the max by
replacing -O0 -g in the Makefile with -O3, then see what you find! Remember
that you need to include a writeup of your findings as part of your problem
set.
